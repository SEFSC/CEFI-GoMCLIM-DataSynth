# Data synthesis for a U.S. Gulf of Mexico Spatial Ecosystem Model
This repository represents the data inputs, synthesis, and methods to develop a spatially-explicit U.S. Gulf-wide Ecosystem Model (USGWEM). Our overall objective is to support ecosystem-based fisheries management in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). The model represents a synthesis of fishery information on species of commercial, recreational, and ecological importance.

The USGWEM applies the Ecopath with Ecosim and Ecospace (EwE) software suite to capture trade-offs associated with trophic interactions and fishing dynamics. Each EwE module builds upon the previous ones, offering an increasingly sophisticated and comprehensive toolset for ecosystem-based management and decision-making. 
1. The **Ecopath** model is the foundation of the other two tools and provides a snapshot of an ecosystem's foodweb at a particular point in time. This quantifies the interaction of functional groups (i.e., species, age stanzas for a species, or groups of organisms that share the same function in the food web). The Ecopath model includes diet composition, production, consumption, and biomass for each group. 2. 2. **Ecosim** simulates changes in the Ecopath model over time. First, the model is fitted to historical timeseries by altering the vulnerability parameters of predator-prey interactions. Future projections of the fitted model can examine responses to management action, fishing, and/or environmental changes.
4. **Ecospace** uses spatially explicit information about habitats, spatial-temporal environmental changes, and dispersal patterns to simulate how changes in the ecosystem (e.g., due to fishing or environmental factors) propagate through time and space. Specifically, Ecosim runs over a matrix of gridded cells to allow functional groups to move between these cells. The speed that groups move between cells is based on dispersal rates for the functional group. The impetus to move will be due to preferences for habitat, environmental drivers, (e.g., temperature, salinity, primary production), and the preferences we set for the functional groups to habitat and environmental drivers. This allows for the prediction of species distribution patterns and the impacts of spatial management measures (like Marine Protected Areas) or environmental changes (like habitat loss).

Our objective here was to develop a spatially-explicit Ecospace
