Occur inshore in summer, but at least some moving into deeper waters from October (Mississippi Delta area). Feed in dense schools, filtering phytoplankton, but probably also feed at the bottom. Apparently breed in winter (October to February, with a peak in January). Salinity tolerance range from 0.1-60 ppt, but the commercial catch is mostly from 5.0-24 ppt. Make inshore-offshore movements (Ref. 34923). Larvae stay in offshore waters for 3-5 weeks before moving into estuaries where they grow into adults (Ref. 34923).
